*About Me*
I would love to be Intern in Database Developer / Business Analyst with my skills in SQL Server, database design, stored procedures, business logic implementation. 
I enjoy solving real-world problems, designing reliable systems, design databases, ensuring data integrit. 

*Projects*
1. Attendance Face Recognition System
- Status: 70% - 80% completed
- Tech Stack: Node.js - Express - SQL Server - face-api.js - REST APIs
- A system that manages employee attendance using facial recognition technology. Built for organizations that require automated timekeeping with security, accuracy, and shift-based rules.
  *My Responsibilities*
  1. Designed the entire SQL Server database (ERD, tables, relationships)
  2. Draw Use cases, workflows
  3. Built most backend APIs using Node.js + Express (update face data to database, check in, check out,...)
  4. Implemented business rules using triggers & SQL logic
  5. Developed attendance flow: CheckIn, CheckOut, shift validation, late/on-time calculation
  *Main Features*
  - Facial Recognition Attendance
      Employees check-in/check-out using face descriptors
      Update time and check in status with the time they check-in/check-out
      Let employee update their face data and the system save it to database if they haven't had face data
  - Role-Based Authentication
      Admin: System-level management
      Manager: Approve leave, view attendance reports
      Employee: View schedule, request leave, check-in/out
  - Attendance & Shift Management
      SQL triggers enforce business rules
      Prevent check-in for employees outside assigned shift
  - Leave Management
      Employees submit leave requests
      Auto-populates attendance during approved leave
      Manager/Admin approve or reject requests
  - Employee Management
      Manage employee profiles

2. Library Management System — SQL Server + ASP.NET MVC
- Tech Stack: SQL Server - ASP.NET MVC - Triggers
- Focus: Business Logic, Database Architecture
- This school library management system manages users, books, borrow operations, penalties, reservations, and librarian approval workflows. I designed the entire backend logic focusing heavily on data integrity, business rules, and automation.
  *My Responsibilities*
  1. Designed all database tables, ERD, relationships
  2. Draw Use cases, workflows, acitivity diagram
  3. Implemented many SQL triggers to enforce real-world library rules
  *Key Modules*
  - Users
      Student / Teacher / Librarian
      Role-based permissions
  - Books & Categories
      TotalCopies & AvailableCopies auto-updated
  - Borrowing / BorrowDetails / BorrowRequest
      Borrow request workflow
      Due date validation
      Auto-update borrowing statuses
  - Reservations
      Trigger-based auto reservation when no copies available
  - Business Logic Implemented (via SQL Triggers)
      Only librarians can approve borrowing or create fines
      Auto-increase available copies when books are returned
      Limit 5 books per BorrowID
      Prevent borrowing more than available copies
      Return date cannot exceed current date
      Auto-update borrow status
